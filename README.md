### What are Outliers?
<p align="justify">In statistical terms, outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the dataset. These outliers can arise due to various reasons such as measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or even genuine extreme values. To give an example, suppose we want to find the average salary of people in a certain neighborhood, and due to maybe a data collection error, Elon Musk's info was included as part of the data. In this situation, our calculation would not be a true representation of the average salary due to Elon's salary. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial as they can distort statistical analyses and machine learning models. In this <a href="https://github.com/Oyebamiji-Micheal/Outlier-Detection-and-Removal-using-Boxplot-and-Percentile/blob/main/detect_and_remove_outliers.ipynb">notebook</a>, I have addressed outlier detection and removal using boxplots and percentiles.
